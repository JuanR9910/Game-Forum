# Game review forum

Project 4 Pitch:

My plan is to finish my previous project 2 the Game Review Forum or it's new name Angry Gamers. It is a full-stack application using the tech stacks EJS, Postgres, Psql, Nodemon, Nodejs, and Express.
 It's an app that will allow the user to make an account so they can make a review for the game that they love or hate. 
They can favorite games they like and post, edit or delete their reviews for that game. 
The home page will display a list of games that players mostly favorited and a list of games that players least favorited and these games will have clickable links that will send them to the review page where they can see other people's
comments and see what they think about the game. 
The webpages will also provide a search bar to easyily find the games they are looking for. The user with a created account can also post their own reviews on it as well as have a profile to display a list of their favorite games.
I will be using the IGDB API to pull data from such as the game ids, genres and many more to be able to have users find the games they want to talk about. 
My database which has already been created will be using postgres and psql here is an ERD showing a graph of my database:

With this database I will be able to pull data from it to render my comments, games and users. 

My MVP Goals will be to create an app with basic functionality such as being able to create an account to access the apps features, having the user be able to search for the game they desire to comment on. 
Have the user be able to post, edit or delete their own comments they want, this will require me to create GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes for the comments controllers with javascript.
 Have the games come with clickable links that will redirect the user to the review page where they can talk about the game they want however they please. 
Finally have a profile page where the user can have their own list of games that they love as well as letting the user favorite the games they want in the review page and that game they favorited will be redirected to their profile page and added to their list. 


My Stretch Goal for the end of this is to well....make another project lol. Work in progress......
